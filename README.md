Repository for the ACT-R model of mind-wandering used in "Frequency of Mind-Wandering in a Sustained Attention to Response Task: A Cognitive Model of Distraction"

Semantic Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)

In each trial, the participant sees a word that is either a fruit or an animal.
They must press a key every time a fruit appears (89% of trials), but withhold their response when the stimulus is an animal (11% of trials).
The model can be run with the following commands:
(do-trial-apple) --> to run a target trial
(do-trial-dog) --> to run a non-target trial
(do-sart) --> to run one block of trials for 1 participant
(do-sart-n N) --> to run one block of trials for N participants
